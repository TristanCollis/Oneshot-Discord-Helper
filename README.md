# Oneshot-Discord-Helper
## A bot that helps run my Discord-based Tabletop RPG.

This bot adds a few useful commands that help me run a one-shot Tabletop RPG game in my homebrew system, **A4 RPG**.
Among other things, it:
- Intercepts text messages in specific channels
- Tracks the passage of time within the game
- Gives players commands to unlock and access specific hidden text channels.
